title: Incubator Example

The example is actively maintained in the its [own dedicated repository](https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/example_digital-twin_incubator).

Due to the need to actively ensure that no example becomes broken, we've decided to keep the different **examples as unit tests** that are part of the main incubator project.
This ensures that **they are run regularly** and any potential issues are quickly found and fixed.

The content below helps **map the examples in the book with the corresponding unit tests** in the incubator repository.
